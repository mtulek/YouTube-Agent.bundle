# YouTube-Agent.bundle

[Work In Progress]

This is a modified agent that will allow for matching on names of files in addition to the ID as a fallback.

I have a reasonably large directory of music videos from YouTube that I would like to populate with the correct metadata in Plex. Older files do not have an ID in their name, although they do have the exact name that the video has on YouTube.

This is an attempt to pull the correct metadata accordingly.

A valid API key needs to be set up for the additions to work.
